Bootstrap :
    - a front-end framework used for building responsive,
    - mobile-first websites and web applications.
    - It provides pre-designed CSS, JavaScript,
    - and components (like buttons, navbars, grids, modals, forms, and carousels) that help developers create consistent and modern user interfaces quickly.


Key Features of Bootstrap:

    - Responsive Grid System – A 12-column grid that makes layout design flexible and adaptable to all screen sizes.
    - Pre-styled Components – Includes ready-to-use UI elements (alerts, modals, navbars, dropdowns, etc.).
    - Utility Classes – Quick classes for spacing, colors, typography, and more.
    - Cross-browser Compatibility – Works well across all modern browsers.
    - JavaScript Plugins – Built-in components powered by JavaScript (like carousels, tooltips, modals).

Advantages of Bootstrap for Developers:

    - Speeds Up Development – Saves time with pre-built styles and components.
    - Responsive by Default – Websites adjust automatically to different screen sizes.
    - Consistency – Ensures design consistency across projects and teams.
    - Customizable – Developers can include only what they need (via Sass variables or Bootstrap’s custom builds).
    - Large Community & Documentation – Well-documented and supported by a massive developer community.
    - Cross-browser Compatibility – Eliminates common CSS issues across different browsers.
    - Integration Friendly – Can be combined with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, or used in plain HTML/CSS projects.
